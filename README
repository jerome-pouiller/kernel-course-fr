EMBEDDED LINUX TRAINING
=======================
Jérôme Pouiller <jezz@sysmic.org>

This  directory contains  training material  about Linux  kernel. This
course is written in French.

This training  is the  next part of  another training  called "Embedded
Linux Training" that you can find on my site.

Even it is not mandatory, I  suggest to purchase a board referenced as
USB-A9263 to Calao (I may also  supply some board if you mail me). You
will also  need BSP for this board.  This one is also  available on my
site: http://sysmic.org/training/BSP

How to compile
--------------

These  are  written  in  LaTeX  with beamer.  If  you  have  correctly
installed your LaTeX distribution, a simple "pdflatex main.tex" should
be  sifficient to compile  pdf version  of this  course. You  can also
found an already compiled version on http://sysmic.org/training/kernel
